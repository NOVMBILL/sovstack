Below is the **L2 “Network Cloak” Protocol** – only this layer, nothing else.
It **sits on top of L1** (CLEAN LAPTOP + CLEAN PHONE already exist).

Two levels:

* **BASIC (MVS)** – everyone must do this
* **ADVANCED** – extra armor (Tor modes, travel, public Wi-Fi patterns)

---

# 0. What You’re Building at L2

You are building **three things**:

1. **One Home Pipe**
   → Home Wi-Fi → VPN → Internet

2. **Two Cloaked Devices**
   → CLEAN LAPTOP → always through VPN
   → CLEAN PHONE → always through VPN

3. **One Ghost Mode**
   → Tor Browser on CLEAN LAPTOP for high-anonymity sessions

Everything else (DIRTY devices, public Wi-Fi without VPN) = synthetic / untrusted.

---

# 1. Prerequisites

You already have from L0/L1:

* ✅ `my-secrets.kdbx` (L0 vault) working on CLEAN LAPTOP + CLEAN PHONE
* ✅ CLEAN LAPTOP (Debian with full-disk encryption)
* ✅ CLEAN PHONE (GrapheneOS Pixel or TEMP CLEAN phone)
* ✅ DIRTY devices labeled

For L2, you need:

* 📝 Paper + ✍️ Pen
* 💻 CLEAN LAPTOP connected to home Wi-Fi
* 📱 CLEAN PHONE
* 🌐 One VPN account number or username:

  * **Mullvad** (account number, no email) **or**
  * **IVPN** (account/alias)

Write on paper:

> `VPN PROVIDER: ___________`
> `VPN ACCOUNT / NUMBER: ___________`

Keep this with your L0/L1 notes (not next to the router).

---

# 2. Name Your Networks (Mental Map)

On paper, draw:

> `NETWORK MAP`
>
> 1. `HOME PRIVATE NET` – your home Wi-Fi name
> 2. `PHONE HOTSPOT` – mobile hotspot from CLEAN PHONE (optional)
> 3. `PUBLIC NETS` – cafés, hotels, airports, work Wi-Fi

Underneath, write:

> **RULE:**
> CLEAN LAPTOP + CLEAN PHONE only talk to internet **through VPN**.
> `PUBLIC NETS` are allowed **only with VPN ON**.

Tick:

* [ ] HOME PRIVATE NET written
* [ ] PUBLIC NETS written
* [ ] RULE written

# 3. BASIC – Install VPN on CLEAN LAPTOP (Debian)

## 3.1 Download VPN client

On **CLEAN LAPTOP**:

1. Open browser.

---

## 3.3 Enable AUTO-CONNECT + KILL SWITCH

In VPN settings (CLEAN LAPTOP):

1. Turn ON:

   * `Start on system boot` or `Launch on login`
   * `Auto-connect` to a server (can choose “Best” or a nearby country)
2. Turn ON:

   * `Kill switch` or `Block internet when not connected`
3. Turn ON:

   * `Use VPN DNS` or `Block DNS leaks`
4. If there is an option:

   * `Block IPv6` → ON (for simplicity)

2. Open browser.

3. Search `what is my ip` or use provider’s “Check” page (e.g. Mullvad’s check page).

4. Confirm:

   * IP location **is not** your real city / ISP
   * It shows VPN provider location

5. Disconnect VPN.

6. Try to load a website (any).

   * If kill switch is working, page **should not** load.

7. Reconnect VPN; try again.

   * Page should now load.

Tick:

* [ ] IP shows VPN location, not ISP
* [ ] Internet is blocked when VPN is off (kill switch works)
* [ ] Internet works again when VPN is on

* For iOS: set VPN to connect automatically where possible (no perfect kill switch – note below).

Write on paper:

> `TEMP CLEAN PHONE LIMIT:`
> iOS has weaker kill switch.
> Treat cellular + Wi-Fi as **more leaky** than GrapheneOS.

Tick:

* [ ] TEMP CLEAN caveat written

# 5. BASIC – Simple Use Modes (Traffic Lights)

Make a small table on paper and tape near CLEAN LAPTOP:

# 7. Wi-Fi and Travel Protocols

## 7.1 At Home (HOME PRIVATE NET)

For CLEAN LAPTOP:

1. Boot laptop.
2. Unlock disk and log in.
3. Connect to HOME PRIVATE NET Wi-Fi.
4. Wait for VPN to auto-connect (check icon).
5. Only then open browser, wallet, or chat.

1. Unlock phone.
2. Confirm VPN key icon is visible (always-on).
3. Use apps normally.

Tick:

* [ ] Home workflow written and understood

---

## 7.2 On Public Wi-Fi (café, hotel, airport)

For CLEAN LAPTOP:

1. Connect to `PUBLIC NET` Wi-Fi.
2. Immediately open VPN app if not auto-connected.
3. Check VPN is connected.
4. Only then open browser / apps.

For CLEAN PHONE:

1. Connect to `PUBLIC NET` Wi-Fi.
2. Confirm VPN key icon is on.
3. Only then use apps.

**If VPN will not connect** on that network:

* Do **not** use CLEAN devices on that Wi-Fi.
* Option 1: Use CLEAN PHONE’s **mobile data** (no Wi-Fi) with VPN.
* Option 2: Use CLEAN PHONE as **hotspot**:

  1. CLEAN PHONE: Hotspot ON (VPN ON).
  2. CLEAN LAPTOP: connect to phone hotspot.
  3. VPN on laptop ON as well (double cloak but fine).

Write:

> `PUBLIC NET RULE:`
> No VPN = no traffic from CLEAN devices.

Tick:

* [ ] Public Wi-Fi rule written

---

# 8. DNS – Simple Setting

On CLEAN LAPTOP VPN app:

* Ensure `Use VPN DNS` is ON.
* If there is “Prevent DNS leaks” → ON.

On CLEAN PHONE VPN app:

* Same: use the app’s DNS settings (if visible) or accept defaults
  (Mullvad/IVPN already route DNS correctly when VPN is ON).

Do **not** change DNS in system settings on CLEAN devices unless you know exactly why. Let VPN handle it.

Tick:

* [ ] VPN DNS enabled on laptop
* [ ] VPN DNS enabled on phone

Under it:

1. Never open CLEAN LAPTOP or CLEAN PHONE browser **with VPN OFF** (except for rare, explicitly chosen maintenance tasks).
2. Never log into **bank/KYC exchange** from CLEAN devices. Use DIRTY device.
3. Never install random “free VPN” apps on any device.
4. Never use public Wi-Fi for CLEAN devices without VPN successfully connected.
5. Never log into real-name accounts inside Tor Browser.

Tick:

* [ ] L2 NEVER DO LIST written and visible

---

# 10. Weekly & Monthly L2 Checklists

## Weekly (5–10 minutes)

On CLEAN LAPTOP:

* [ ] Reboot once. Confirm VPN auto-connect works.
* [ ] Confirm kill switch blocks traffic when you manually disconnect VPN.
* [ ] Open Tor Browser (if installed) and ensure it still connects.

On CLEAN PHONE:

* [ ] Confirm the VPN key icon is always present.
* [ ] Turn Airplane Mode ON and OFF → confirm VPN reconnects.

## Monthly (15–20 minutes)

* [ ] Check VPN subscription still valid (days left).
* [ ] Check home router Wi-Fi password is still non-default and not shared widely.
* [ ] Try connecting CLEAN LAPTOP to a `PUBLIC NET` (café, library) and confirm:

  * VPN connects
  * No traffic before VPN

---

# 11. Edge Cases and Emergency Branches

### Case 1 – A site blocks your VPN

* If it’s **bank / KYC / government / streaming**:

  * Use a **DIRTY device** for that site (with or without its own VPN).
  * Do **not** disable VPN on CLEAN LAPTOP or CLEAN PHONE just to reach it.

### Case 2 – VPN Provider Goes Down or Becomes Suspicious

* Temporarily:

  * Do **not** browse from CLEAN devices until you:

    * Switch to backup provider, **or**
    * Use CLEAN PHONE hotspot + second VPN, etc.

* Long term:

  * Get a second VPN provider (IVPN if using Mullvad, or vice versa).
  * Configure it as backup profile on CLEAN LAPTOP and CLEAN PHONE.

### Case 3 – You Accidentally Used CLEAN DEVICE Without VPN

* If you briefly browsed with VPN OFF:

  * Turn VPN back ON immediately.
  * Do not panic; note which sites were opened.

* If you logged into social media, KYC exchange, or bank:

  * That CLEAN device is now **contaminated**:

    * Option A: Accept new role = DIRTY, get a new CLEAN device.
    * Option B: Fully wipe and rebuild OS, re-apply L1 + L2 protocol from scratch.

Write:

> `DEVICE CONTAMINATION RULE:`
> If CLEAN device does KYC/social, it becomes DIRTY until wiped.

Tick:

* [ ] Contamination rule written

# 12. Final Micro-Checklist (Caveman Version)

To verify L2 “Network Cloak” is in place:

1. [ ] CLEAN LAPTOP has VPN app installed, set to auto-connect, kill switch ON, DNS via VPN.
2. [ ] CLEAN PHONE has VPN app installed, always-on VPN + block-without-VPN (or nearest equivalent).
3. [ ] At home, CLEAN devices never browse before VPN is connected.
4. [ ] On public Wi-Fi, CLEAN devices only send traffic with VPN ON, or use phone hotspot instead.
5. [ ] Tor Browser exists on CLEAN LAPTOP for GHOST MODE and is used only with VPN ON and no real-name logins.
6. [ ] L2 NEVER DO LIST is taped near CLEAN LAPTOP.
7. [ ] Weekly + monthly L2 checks are done.

If all 7 are true, **L2 Network Cloak** is wrapped around your **L1 Device Shell** and **L0 Secret Box** and all traffic from CLEAN devices now passes through a predictable, controlled privacy pipeline.
