At a high level, the protocol is built around one idea:

> You’re not trying to be a specialist, you’re trying to live permanently on the **Pareto frontier** of strength, size, speed, mobility, and conditioning.

From that, everything else follows.

### 1. Frontier, not fantasy

Biologically you can’t sit at the absolute world-record max of each trait at the same time. So the target is the **zone** where all five are *very* high, and any gain in one would only buy you a tiny improvement at the cost of a meaningful loss in another.

The protocol is designed to keep you in that zone:

* Strong enough to handle heavy barbell work.
* Big enough to look clearly trained.
* Fast and powerful enough to sprint and jump hard.
* Conditioned enough that hard intervals don’t phase you.
* Mobile and durable enough to keep doing this for decades.

### 2. Constraint-based concurrent training

Instead of blindly “doing everything,” it treats concurrent training as a **constraint satisfaction problem**:

* **Volume caps** per muscle and per session (no junk sets).
* **Limits on HIIT and sprint doses** per week (no interference spiral).
* **Mode selection**: a lot of conditioning on bike/row to protect legs and strength.
* **Ordering**: speed → strength → conditioning to preserve power.

Inside those constraints, you get as much adaptation as possible without the traits sabotaging each other.

### 3. Always-on, rotating emphasis

You never turn any quality “off.” Instead, the macro-cycle rotates emphasis:

* Strength-tilt → Hypertrophy-tilt → Engine/Speed-tilt.

In each block, one dial goes up slightly while the others are held at a strong maintenance level. That lets you keep all systems online while pushing one edge a bit further, then rotating.

### 4. Durability as a first-class goal

Most “do everything” programs die from:

* Joint/tendon breakdown
* CNS burnout
* Sneaky accumulation of fatigue from sprints + heavy legs + HIIT

So the protocol bakes in:

* On-ramp phases
* Hard limits on max-velocity sprint frequency
* One full rest day and one low-stress day
* Daily-ish mobility / loaded stretching / isometrics

The goal is not just performance **now**, but the ability to repeat this template for years.

### 5. Quality over volume

Finally, it assumes:

* You’re advanced enough that more volume isn’t automatically better.
* Progress comes from **high-quality sets at appropriate RPE**, not endless junk.

So every part of the week is there to move a clear lever (strength, size, speed, engine, or mobility) and nothing is filler.

In short: it’s a lifelong, constraint-respecting way to stay brutally capable across all physical qualities simultaneously, without letting the pursuit of one ruin the others.


## 1. Global rules (non-negotiable architecture)

**Volume (per muscle group)**

* Default: **8–14 hard sets/week** per big muscle group (quads, hams/glutes, chest, back, shoulders).
* Peaks (hypertrophy blocks): up to **16–18 sets/week** for 1–2 chosen muscles.
* Per-session cap: **≤6–8 direct sets per muscle**.

**Intensity & RPE**

* Heavy strength work: **RPE 7–9**, 3–6 reps.
* Hypertrophy work: **RPE 7–10**, 6–15 reps.
* No regular grinders to true failure on heavy barbell compounds.

**Conditioning**

* **2 hard conditioning exposures per week** (sprints/HIIT).
* At least one of them on **bike/row/assault**, not both as hard running.
* Optional 1×/week **easy Zone 2** (30–45 min, conversational pace).

**Speed**

* **1×/week true max-velocity sprint session**.
* Optional 2nd lighter session = tempos or submax accelerations/bike sprints.

**Ordering inside a day**

1. Speed / plyos
2. Strength
3. Conditioning

If you split sessions: speed/strength in the morning, conditioning later.

**Recovery**

* 1 full rest day/week.
* Sleep: 7–9 hours.
* Food: maintenance or slight surplus most of the time; not chronically low-carb.

## 2. Weekly structure (5+1)

**Day 1 – Lower Strength + Low-Volume Plyo**
**Day 2 – Upper Strength + Hypertrophy**
**Day 3 – Speed + Hard Conditioning**
**Day 4 – Lower Hypertrophy + Assistance**
**Day 5 – Upper Hypertrophy + Power**
**Day 6 – Optional Easy Conditioning + Long Mobility**
**Day 7 – Full Rest (light walk + easy mobility only)**

You can run it as **5 days** (drop Day 6) or **5+1** if recovery is solid.

---

## 3. Day-by-day protocol

Choose **one**:

1. **Bike/Row HIIT**

    → Total ≈ **11–13 sets**

* Hams/glutes:

  * Day 1: 3 (hinge) + split overload
  * Day 4: 3 (RDL/GM) + 2–3 (curl/hip thrust)
    → ~10–12 sets

Firmly inside the 8–14 sweet spot, with room to push to 16–18 in hypertrophy emphasis.

---

### Day 5 – Upper Hypertrophy + Power

**A. Power**

1. **Med-Ball Chest Pass or Rotational Throw**

   * 3×3–5 (each side for rotational)
   * Full intent, low fatigue

**B. Horizontal push**

2. **DB Bench Press (flat or incline)**

   * 3×8–12 @ RPE 7–9

**C. Horizontal pull**

3. **Row (different from Day 2)**

   * e.g., one-arm DB row, cable row
   * 3×8–12 @ RPE 7–9

**D. Vertical push**

**Mobility (5–10 min)**

* Shoulder CARs
* Scapular wall slides
* T-spine rotations

**Weekly upper volume summary**

* Push:

  * Day 2: 4 (bench) + 3 (OHP) + 2 (CGBP/dip) = 9
  * Day 5: 3 (DB bench) + 2–3 (DB OHP) = 5–6
    → ~**14–15 sets** (high but fine for growth; in non-hypertrophy blocks you can remove 2–3 sets).

* Pull:

  * Day 2: 4 (pull-up) + 3 (row) = 7
  * Day 5: 3 (row) + 2–3 (pulldown) = 5–6
    → ~**12–13 sets**

In “default” mode, you can trim 2–4 sets (e.g., drop 1 push and 1 pull exercise set each) to land at 10–12. In hypertrophy emphasis you keep the full 14–15.

---

### Day 6 – Optional Easy Conditioning + Long Mobility

Only if recovery is solid. Otherwise it’s just rest + light walking.

**A. Conditioning – Easy / moderate**

Pick ONE:

1. **Zone 2 steady**

   * 30–45 min bike, brisk walk, light jog
   * Conversational pace (you can speak in full sentences)

or

2. **Tempo / “cruise” intervals (submax)**

   * 6–8 × 100–200 m @ ~70–80% sprint speed
   * Walk back to start as recovery

**B. Long mobility / tissue (20–30 min)**

* Jefferson curls 2–3×8–10 (light load)
* Cossack squats 3×6–8/side
* Deep static hip flexor + quad stretch 2×30–60 s/side
* Shoulder & hip CARs

---

### Day 7 – Rest

* Walks only.
* Optional 5–10 min very light mobility.
* No “secret workout”.

---

## 4. 18-week macro-cycle (S → H → E, each 6 weeks)

All qualities stay online, but you tilt emphasis and adjust volume/intensity.

### Block 1 – Strength-tilt (Weeks 1–6)

* Main lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, OHP, heavy row):

  * 4–5×3–5 @ RPE 7–9.
* Hypertrophy volume:

  * Keep at lower band: **8–12 sets/week** per muscle.
  * Drop a couple of accessory sets from Days 4 and 5.
* Conditioning:

  * Keep exactly as written (2×/week), but keep HIIT “hard” not “obliterate yourself”.

### Block 2 – Hypertrophy-tilt (Weeks 7–12)

* Main lifts:

  * 3×3–5 @ RPE 7–8 (strength maintenance).
* Hypertrophy:

  * Increase per-muscle volume for 1–2 priority areas up to **14–18 sets/week** (add 1–2 sets to 2–3 exercises).
  * Keep others at 10–14.
* Conditioning:

  * Maintain but don’t add volume; keep HIIT at slightly more moderate intensity (7–8/10) if recovery dips.

### Block 3 – Engine/Speed-tilt (Weeks 13–18)

* Sprints:

  * Slightly increase total contacts (e.g., +1 sprint rep) on Day 3.
* Conditioning:

  * Optionally add 1–2 intervals per HIIT session or keep intensity high but duration the same.
* Strength:

  * Main lifts 2–3×3–5 @ RPE 7–8 (maintenance).
* Hypertrophy:

  * Keep volume around **8–12 sets/week** per muscle.

### Deloads

Every **4th or 7th week** (choose a rhythm and stick to it):

* Cut total sets by ~40–50%.
* Keep movement patterns, but:

  * No sets above RPE 7.
  * Drop sprint count by ~50%.
  * Make HIIT more like brisk intervals (6–7/10).

---

## 5. On-ramp (first 4–6 weeks if coming from lower load)

If you’re not already used to all of this:

* **Halve sprint volume**:

  * 3–4 sprints (20–30 m) on Day 3 instead of 5–8.
* **Dial back HIIT intensity**:

  * 6–8 rounds at 7–8/10 effort instead of 8–10 at 9/10.
* **Use the low end of volume bands**:

  * 2–3 sets instead of 3–4 on many lifts.
* **No grinder sets at all**:

  * Cap at RPE 7–8 during on-ramp.

Once joints/tendons feel good and mornings feel normal, ramp toward the full scheme.

---

## 6. Progression rules

**Heavy lifts (strength)**

* Start with a load you can confidently hit for the target reps at **RPE 7**.
* Each week:

  * If final set ≤RPE 8 and bar speed is good → add **2.5–5 kg** (upper) or **2.5–10 kg** (lower) next week.
  * If you hit RPE 9–10 → repeat weight or drop 2.5–5 kg and build again.

**Hypertrophy lifts**

* Double progression:

  * Choose a rep range (e.g., 8–12).
  * Stay at same weight until you hit the top of the range on all sets at ≤RPE 9.
  * Then bump weight up 2.5–5 kg and restart at the low end of the rep range.

**Sprints**

* Do **not** chase maximal intensity increases weekly.
* Move from:

  * 3–4 reps → 5–6 → 6–8 across weeks.
* Once you’re at 6–8 high-quality sprints, progression is **better quality (mechanics, relaxation)**, not more volume.

**HIIT**

* Fix **interval structure** (e.g., 30s hard / 90s easy, 8 rounds).
* Progression is:

  * Better power during the work bout (higher speed/watts) at the same structure.
  * Not more and more intervals forever.
